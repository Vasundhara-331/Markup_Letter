            <p>Dear Ms. Alice McArthur,</p>

            <p>Thank you for expressing interest in joining our research group at the University of Oregon. I am delighted to learn about your academic background and research interests, which align closely with the ongoing projects in our department.</p>

            <p>Having reviewed your application and supporting documents, I am impressed by your achievements, particularly your work on 'Automotive Ciruits'. Your passion for Applied Electronics is evident, and I believe you would make a valuable addition to our team.</p>

            <p>As part of the next steps, I encourage you to attend an online interview where we can discuss your research aspirations further and explore potential areas of collaboration. Please let us know your availability over the next two weeks, and our team will coordinate accordingly.</p>

            <p>In preparation for the interview, I recommend that you review our recent publications, available on our research portal, to familiarize yourself with our latest work. This will help you identify areas of interest and potential collaboration more effectively.</p>

            <p>Additionally, we encourage you to prepare a brief presentation (5-10 minutes) on your previous research or a topic of interest that aligns with our lab's focus. This will give us further insight into your skills and interests.</p>

            <p>Once again, thank you for considering University of Oregon for your Ph.D. studies. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss your application in greater detail.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>
